## Instagram clone using Laravel 8

  <p>  This project is meant to be a teaching tool for me personally but if you'd like to take a look at it, I'd be extremely happy. That being said, I build following freeCodeCamp's instructions so if you'd like to build an instagram clone just like this one, just head to their youtube channel. </p>

## Day 1

   <p> I started building it. I made a new laravel 8 instalation with bootstrap, added some authentication and a bit of customization. </p>

## Day 2

<p> I made some modifications to my routes, added a profile model and changed some of my front-end to be more similar to that of instagram. </p>
