## Instagram clone using Laravel 8 and Jet Stream

  <p>  This project is meant to be a teaching tool for me personally but if you'd like to take a look at it, I'd be extremely happy. That being said, I build following freeCodeCamp's instructions so if you'd like to build an instagram clone just like this one, just head to their youtube channel. </p>

## Day 1

   <p> I started building it. I made a new laravel project with Jet Stream, added some authentication and a bit of customization. </p>
