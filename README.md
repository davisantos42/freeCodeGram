## Instagram clone using Laravel 8

<p>  This project is meant to be a teaching tool for me personally but if you'd like to take a look at it, I'd be extremely happy. That being said, I build following freeCodeCamp's instructions so if you'd like to build an instagram clone just like this one, just head to their youtube channel. </p>

## Day 1

<p> I started building it. I made a new laravel 8 instalation with bootstrap, added some authentication and a bit of customization. </p>

## Day 2

<p> I made some modifications to my routes, added a profile model and changed some of my front-end to be more similar to that of instagram. </p>

## Day 3

<p> I modify my views quite a bit, implemented a way to add posts and display the posts and their count in the profile page. </p>

## Day 4

<p> I added some editing functionality alongside some modifications in my views and required the intervention/image dependency to manipulate images better. </p>

## Day 5

<p> There's now some following functionality and I started working more on the javascript front-end aspect of this project using Vue.js. There was also some modifications made to the profiles controller, profile and user models, and my main view (index.blade.php) and my post view (show.blade.php). </p>

## Day 6

<p> There was some refactoring in my code to allow caching and now we have it for the profile. I also added an automatic email to every new user who register in the website. </p>
